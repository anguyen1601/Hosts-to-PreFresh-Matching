# Hosts to PreFresh Matching

As a Diversity Outreach Intern for Amherst College we create large overnight programs for visiting students. I previously was part of the Hosting team and am now on the publications team.

A Host is a current Amherst Student who wants to house a visiting student
A PreFresh is a visiting student.

The Hosting Team currently matches a host to a prefresh by hand, selecting based on a large list of criteria.

This program is a start to creating a  program that will read in the survey results and match students based on the criteria. At the moment, the program is matching based on only major and prospective major.

The program uses both a HashTable and AdjacencyList data structures to store and access the data.
